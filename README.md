## Introduction
<p>
Depression is a common illness worldwide with more than 264 million effected. Surprisingly, roughly 800000 commit suicide each year due to depression. Team Echo presents you the CBT solution to help individuals recover from depression and track their growth in realtime. Our team have researched a lot and come up with features that are a key for dealing with depression. Apart from this we also let the user track his/her overall growth. The app helps its users become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations better and respond to them more effectively. Our app also provides the user with a way to track what activities affect his daily mood so  that he/she can promote those activities which are beneficial for them.
